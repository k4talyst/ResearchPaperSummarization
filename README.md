# ResearchPaperSummarization
This project builds a section-wise summarization system for academic research papers. Instead of generating one generic summary, it extracts the structure of a paper from a PDF and produces focused summaries for sections such as the Abstract, Methodology, Results, and Conclusion, with an emphasis on accuracy, structure, and reproducibility.
